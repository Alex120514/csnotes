Sorted by Topics

# Topic 1: System Fundamentals(only briefly mentioned sofar)

Networks: Basic network concepts (LAN, WAN, protocols) and their role in systems.

Social and Ethical Issues: Privacy, security, intellectual property, and environmental impact of computing systems.

# Topic 2:Computer Organization

Computer Architecture: CPU structure (ALU, control unit, registers), fetch-decode-execute cycle.

Memory: Types (RAM, ROM, cache), hierarchy, and addressing.

Binary Representation: Data encoding (numbers, text, images) in binary; logic gates and Boolean algebra.

Instruction Sets: Machine language, assembly language, and role of compilers/interpreters.

Operating Systems: Basic functions (process management, memory allocation, file systems).

# Topic 3: Networks

Network Fundamentals: Types (LAN, WAN, VPN), topologies (star, bus), and components (routers, switches).

Protocols and Standards: TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and OSI model; role of standards in interoperability.

Data Transmission: Packet switching, bandwidth, latency, and error detection/correction.

Security: Encryption, authentication, firewalls, and common threats (e.g., malware, phishing).

Wireless Networking: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks.

# Topic EX: Additional cool stuff only for the coolest HL students

**(Topic 5)Abstract Data Structures:**

-> Advanced structures: Linked lists, trees (binary, binary search trees)

**(Topic 6)Resource management**

-> Operating system roles: Process scheduling, memory management (paging, segmentation), and virtualization.

**(Topic 7)Control**

-> Feedback loops: Sensors, actuators, and controllers in systems (e.g., thermostats, autonomous vehicles).

**Cache Stored Hyperspace Libraries(CSHL) Extensions**

-> Databases: Relational databases, SQL, normalization, and database management systems.

-> Web Science: Web architecture, HTML/CSS, client-server models.
